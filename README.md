The purpose of HelpMeCheat is to allow the user of the application to take a picture of a mathematical expression or problem (hand-written) and then get a step-by-step solution of it.
How it accomplishes this task is that the app first converts the image of the math expression to a format called "LaTEX", which is a language that is used to represent math equations and expressions. The LaTEX expression would then be sent to a backend API where a python-based library break it down into different steps and return the solution to the user.
